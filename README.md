# Time expressions

A time expression is an expression that happens (or not) in a recurrent way

For example:

## Non-recurring

Every 3 days from Thursday, February 22, 2018 to March 15, 2018.

### Day Y every X months from a month to another month

### The Y every X months from a month to another month

The 3rd Friday every 2 months from January 2018 to August 2019.

### The Y every X years from a year to another year

On August 8 every year from 2018 to 2024.

# What do I have to do ?

Write the corresponding implementations in `TimeExpression` to pass the test cases of `TimeExpressionTest`.

## Why do I have to do it ?

We want to see how you design the model of the domain and how you apply TDD as a software development technique

# Important !

In the test cases you can create new types that replace primitives like `int`.
